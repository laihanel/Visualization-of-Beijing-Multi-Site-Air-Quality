# Visualization-of-Beijing-Multi-Site-Air-Quality
Visualization Project  May 4, 2022

## Introduction
Breathing clean air can lessen the possibility of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic and acute respiratory illnesses such as asthma. Lower levels of air pollution are better for heart and respiratory health, both long- and short-term.
Air quality reflects the degree of air pollution, which is judged according to the concentration of pollutants in the air. Air pollution is a complex phenomenon, and the concentration of air pollutants at a given time and place is affected by many factors. Artificial pollutant emissions from stationary and mobile pollution sources are among the most critical factors affecting air quality, including exhaust from vehicles, ships, and airplanes, industrial pollution, residential living and heating, and waste incineration. Urban development density, topography, and weather also affect air quality.
This project based on the hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally controlled air-quality monitoring sites in Beijing, China. Use different graphs to show the changes in various air indicators from 2013 to 2017.
The student used different plots and graphs to show the data, and also created an interactive dash for data visualization.
